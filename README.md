# TerraInvicta.Diplomacy

A mod for Terra Invicta aimed at improving player experience regarding Relations and Diplomacy between Factions.

## Features

### New Diplomatic Treaties:

* `Alliance` - Agreement that makes both factions allied to each other, share intel and prevents hostile actions against
  each other.
* `Break Alliance` - Valid if in an alliance, breaks up the alliance.
* `Reset Bilateral Relations` - Agreement to restart bilateral relations between
  factions. Sets both parties hate towards each other to the default game start values.

### Changes to base game:

* In the base game, when `PlayerFaction` is far ahead, certain treaties like `Truce` or `NAP` can not be made, a
  different approach is used in this mod - treaties are available based on current "relations" and ideology of factions.

### Misc:

* Save compatible after mod removal or game update.
* Works with ongoing saves.

## Upcoming Features

* Improve on existing features (Ai to Ai diplomacy does not use the new features as of yet).
* Add more Diplomacy treaties, such as:
    * "Real" Alliance
    * Shared Intel Treaty
* Improve hate logic in regard to diplomacy treaties.
