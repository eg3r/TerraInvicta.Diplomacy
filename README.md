# TerraInvicta.Diplomacy

A mod for Terra Invicta aimed at improving player experience regarding Relations and Diplomacy between Factions.

## Features

### New Diplomatic Treaties:

* `Alliance` - Agreement that makes both factions allied to each other, share intel and prevents hostile actions against
  each other.
* `Break Alliance` - Valid if in an alliance, breaks up the alliance.
* `Reset Bilateral Relations` - Agreement to restart bilateral relations between
  factions. Sets both parties hate towards each other to the default game start values.

### Changes to base game:

* In the base game, when `PlayerFaction` is far ahead, certain treaties like `Truce` or `NAP` can not be made, a
  different approach is used in this mod - treaties are available based on current "relations" and ideology of factions.

### Misc:

* Save compatible after mod removal or game update.
* Works with ongoing saves.

## Upcoming Features

* Improve on existing features (Ai to Ai diplomacy does not use the new features as of yet).
* Add more Diplomacy treaties, such as:
    * "Real" Alliance
    * Shared Intel Treaty
* Improve hate logic in regard to diplomacy treaties.

### Development Setup

1. Some kind of IDE is needed, that supports .NET (C#) Development, be it from IntelliJ, Microsoft or similar (like VSCode, Rider, Visual Studio etc.)
2. Download and install Unity Mod Manager, this will also get Harmony0 DLL into the game folder (Documentation and infos: https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony )
3. Set the TERRAINVICTA_PATH environment variable to point to your TI installation path
4. run ```dotnet build``` (or ```dotnet build --configuration Release```) to build, on success the setup should copy the mod into the TI active mods folder

To be able to debug using the IDEs debugger, unity debug build needs to be setup correctly for TI.
