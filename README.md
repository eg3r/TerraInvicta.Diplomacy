# TerraInvicta.Diplomacy

A mod for Terra Invicta aimed at improving player experience regarding Relations and Diplomacy between Factions.

## Features

* New Diplomacy/Trade treaty `Reset Bilateral Relations`. An agreement to restart bilateral relations between
  factions. Sets both parties hate towards each other to the default game start values.
* When `PlayerFaction` was far ahead, certain treaties like `Truce` or `NAP` could not be made, this was removed and a
  new system put in place to decide when those treaties are available.
* Saves data separate from game saves and thus is absolutely save game compatible after removal.

## Upcoming Features

* Improve on existing features (Ai to Ai diplomacy does not use the new features as of yet).
* Add more Diplomacy treaties, such as:
    * "Real" Alliance
    * Shared Intel Treaty
* Improve hate logic in regard to diplomacy treaties.
